Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of systematically applying engineering methods to develop and maintain high quality software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming languages in 1947 (fortran).
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The first phase is requirements where gatheing and documenting user needs take place. The second phase is the design phase where high level and detailed designs of the software are created. Implementation, which is the third phase, is where the coding and software building begins. The fourth phase is testing, as the name implies, the sofware is tested to see if it meets the requirements. Deployment is the fifth stage where the finished software is released to the consumers and the final stage is maintainance, here support, updates andenhancment are made after the deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall mehodology has a sequential approach such as requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance and the appropraite scenairo would be when project requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change while agile  methodology breaks the project into small, manageable iterations or sprints and the appropraie scenario would be when project requirements are expected to change frequently.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. The software developer writes code and implemnts software solutions
2. Quality assurance engineer ensures the software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3. The project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software managers.
4. The system architect designs the overall structure of the software sstem
5. The UI/UX designer creates the interface  and design's
 user experience for software appications.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are for wrting, debugging and testing code e.g Eclipse. VCS is for tracking changes to the source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing requirements during the developemnt cycle( ample time should be given to the users to make informed decisions)
2. Tight deadlines ( developers should be alloted enough time to get products fully developed)
3. Technical debt ( budgets should be revisited during every development phase to make sure that no debts would be incurred in the forseeable future)

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing  - individual components/ modules are tested.
2. Integration testing - intractions between different components and subsystems are tested.
3. System tesing - testing the sstem as a whole entity.
4. Acceptance testing - testing the software against thhe user requirements formerly gathered to ensure it meets their needs.


Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is he process of refining questons or instructions in a way that helps you get the best responses from your robot or AI chatbot

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt  - i need a ist of restaurants in Abuja.
Clear prompt- I need a list of 5 star restaurants in Abuja around the Central Area District.
The first prompt would give you a list of restaurants, some that may not suit our taste while the second prompt narrows down the search given your location, making it easier to find the right restaurant for you.
